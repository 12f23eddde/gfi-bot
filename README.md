# GFI-Bot

ML-powered ðŸ¤– for finding and labeling good first issues in your GitHub project!

The tool is based on the following paper:
W. Xiao, H. He, W. Xu, X. Tan, J. Dong, M. Zhou. Recommending Good First Issues in GitHub OSS Projects. ICSE'2022 (https://icse2022.hotcrp.com/)

## Get Started

TODO: Add a quick usage guide after a prototype is finished.

## Development

### Project Organization

GFI-Bot is organized into five main modules:

1. [`gfibot.data`](gfibot/data): Modules to periodically and incrementally collect latest issue statistics on registered GitHub projects.
2. [`gfibot.model`](gfibot/data): Modules to periodically train GFI recommendation models based on issue statistics collected by [`gfibot.data`](gfibot/data).
3. [`gfibot.backend`](gfibot/backend): Modules to provide RESTful APIs for interaction with [`frontend`](frontend).
4. [`frontend`](frontend): A standalone JavaScript (or TypeScript?) project as our website. This website will be used both as the main portal of GFI-Bot and as a control panel for users to find recommended good first issues or track bot status for their projects.
5. [`github-app`](github-app): A standalone JavaScript (or TypeScript?) project for interacting with GitHub.

All modules interact with a MongoDB instance for both reading and writing data (except [`frontend`](frontend), which interact with backend using RESTful APIs). The MongoDB instance serves as a "single source of truth" and the main way to decouple different modules. It will be used to store and continiously update issue statistics, training progress and performance, recommendation results, etc.

### Environment Setup

GFI-Bot uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Run the following commands with poetry to setup a working environment.

```shell script
poetry shell       # activate a working virtual environment
poetry install     # install all dependencies
pre-commit install # install pre-commit hooks
black .            # lint all Python code
pytest             # run all tests to confirm this environment is working
```

Then, configure a MongoDB instance (4.2 or later) and specify its connection URL in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml). Run the following script to properly initialize a database for GFI-Bot. It will create a new database named `gfibot`, create necessary collections, create indexes, and enforce schemas for each collection.

```shell script
python -m gfibot.init_db
```

### Database Schemas

As mentioned before, the MongoDB instance serves as a "single source of truth" and decouples different modules. Therefore, before you start working with any part of GFI-Bot, it is important to know how the data look like in the MongoDB. For this purpose, we adopt [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) to formally describe and enforce schemas for each MongoDB collection. We provide the following MongoDB collections and all collection schemas are available in the [`schemas/`](schemas) folder:

* [`gfibot.repositories`](schemas/repositories.json): Stores repository statistics for RecGFI training. Has a compound unique index on (`name`, `owner`).
* [`gfibot.issues`](schemas/issues.json): Stores issue statistics for RecGFI training. Has a compound unique index on (`repo_name`, `repo_owner`, `number`).
* [`gfibot.users`](schemas/users.json): Stores user statistics for RecGFI training. Has a unique index on `name`.
* [`gfibot.users.repo`](schemas/users.repo.json): Stores user statistics *per repository* for RecGFI training. Has a compound unique index on (`repo_name`, `repo_owner`, `name`).

## Deployment

First, determine some GitHub projects of interest and specify them in [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml). Configure a list of GitHub access tokens (line separated) in `tokens.txt`. Make sure to use more tokens in order to quickly bootstrap GFI-Bot. Run the following script to check if the tokens are configured correctly.

```shell script
python -m gfibot.check_tokens
```

Next, run the following script to collect historical data for the interested projects. This can take some time (up to days) to finish for the first run, so better run as a background task.

```shell script
python -m gfibot.data.update
```
